# React Tic Tac Toe Project

This project is for my Internet Software Development class at Texas State University.

As a group, we plan on creating Tic Tac Toe in React.js, but adding some extra features to it.

Some of the extra features are listed below.

## Extra Features
1. More Tiles!
    * Tic Tac Toe is usually on a 3x3 grid, we plan on creating a 9x9 grid, or even possibly allowing the user to choose which size grid they want to play on.
2. More Players!
    * Tic Tac Toe usually only has two player (X and O), we plan on allowing users to select more than two players (X, O, Y, Z, etc.).
3. Plus some more features!
